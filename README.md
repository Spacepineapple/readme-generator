## URL <a id="url"></a>
The repository for this project can be found at
https://github.com/Spacepineapple/readme-generator. Please note that as this
programme uses Node.js, it has not been deployed and there is no URL for the
'live' programme.

## Description <a id="description"></a>

## Installation <a id="installation"></a>

This file requires Node.js and the inquirer package. Node.js can be installed
from https://nodejs.org/en/ and the inquirer package can be installed using the
Node Package Manager and the command: "npm install inquirer".

## Usage <a id="usage"></a>

To use this programme, first download the repository contents including all of
the source code and if necessary, extract the files if in a zip format.
Following this, open the command line or terminal and navigate to the folder
containing the unzipped files. Type "node index.mjs" (without the speech marks)
and answer each of the questions in the terminal by typing an answer. Please
note that for the question around licenses, you will need to select an option
from the list -- this can be done using the up and down arrow keys and hitting
return or enter when the highlighted option corresponds to the license you wish
to use. Following this, the generated README file can be found in the
generated_readme folder with the name README.md.

## Credits <a id="credits"></a>

This README generator was produced by myself using starter code provided by EdX
as part of their Front End Web Development bootcamp. This starter code included
empty functions and variables for holding the questions and logic, as well as an
empty generate markdown function. My solution makes use of both the filesystem
and inquirer modules which I did not produce and for which I can take no credit.
